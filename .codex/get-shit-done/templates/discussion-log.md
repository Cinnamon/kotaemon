# Discussion Log Template

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-DISCUSSION-LOG.md` — audit trail of discuss-phase Q&A sessions.

**Purpose:** Software audit trail for decision-making. Captures all options considered, not just the selected one. Separate from CONTEXT.md which is the implementation artifact consumed by downstream agents.

**NOT for LLM consumption.** This file should never be referenced in `<files_to_read>` blocks or agent prompts.

## Format

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Discussion Log

> **Audit trail only.** Do not use as input to planning, research, or execution agents.
> Decisions are captured in CONTEXT.md — this log preserves the alternatives considered.

**Date:** [ISO date]
**Phase:** [phase number]-[phase name]
**Areas discussed:** [comma-separated list]
