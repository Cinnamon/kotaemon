<purpose>
Create a pull request from completed phase/milestone work, generate a rich PR body from planning artifacts, optionally run code review, and prepare for merge. Closes the plan → execute → verify → ship loop.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="initialize">
Parse arguments and load project state:

```bash
INIT=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init phase-op "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Parse from init JSON: `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `padded_phase`, `commit_docs`.

Also load config for branching strategy:
```bash
CONFIG=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state load)
```

Extract: `branching_strategy`, `branch_name`.
</step>

<step name="preflight_checks">
Verify the work is ready to ship:

1. **Verification passed?**
   ```bash
   VERIFICATION=$(cat ${PHASE_DIR}/*-VERIFICATION.md 2>/dev/null)
   ```
   Check for `status: passed` or `status: human_needed` (with human approval).
   If no VERIFICATION.md or status is `gaps_found`: warn and ask user to confirm.

2. **Clean working tree?**
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```
   If uncommitted changes exist: ask user to commit or stash first.

3. **On correct branch?**
   ```bash
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   ```
   If on `main`/`master`: warn — should be on a feature branch.
   If branching_strategy is `none`: offer to create a branch now.

4. **Remote configured?**
   ```bash
   git remote -v | head -2
   ```
   Detect `origin` remote. If no remote: error — can't create PR.

5. **`gh` CLI available?**
   ```bash
   which gh && gh auth status 2>&1
   ```
   If `gh` not found or not authenticated: provide setup instructions and exit.
</step>

<step name="push_branch">
Push the current branch to remote:

```bash
git push origin ${CURRENT_BRANCH} 2>&1
```

If push fails (e.g., no upstream): set upstream:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin ${CURRENT_BRANCH} 2>&1
```

Report: "Pushed `{branch}` to origin ({commit_count} commits ahead of main)"
</step>

<step name="generate_pr_body">
Auto-generate a rich PR body from planning artifacts:

**1. Title:**
```
Phase {phase_number}: {phase_name}
```
Or for milestone: `Milestone {version}: {name}`

**2. Summary section:**
Read ROADMAP.md for phase goal. Read VERIFICATION.md for verification status.

```markdown
## Summary

**Phase {N}: {Name}**
**Goal:** {goal from ROADMAP.md}
**Status:** Verified ✓

{One paragraph synthesized from SUMMARY.md files — what was built}
```

**3. Changes section:**
For each SUMMARY.md in the phase directory:
```markdown
## Changes

### Plan {plan_id}: {plan_name}
{one_liner from SUMMARY.md frontmatter}

**Key files:**
{key-files.created and key-files.modified from SUMMARY.md frontmatter}
```

**4. Requirements section:**
```markdown
## Requirements Addressed

{REQ-IDs from plan frontmatter, linked to REQUIREMENTS.md descriptions}
```

**5. Testing section:**
```markdown
## Verification

- [x] Automated verification: {pass/fail from VERIFICATION.md}
- {human verification items from VERIFICATION.md, if any}
```

**6. Decisions section:**
```markdown
## Key Decisions

{Decisions from STATE.md accumulated context relevant to this phase}
```
</step>

<step name="create_pr">
Create the PR using the generated body:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}: ${PHASE_NAME}" \
  --body "${PR_BODY}" \
  --base main
```

If `--draft` flag was passed: add `--draft`.

Report: "PR #{number} created: {url}"
</step>

<step name="optional_review">
Ask if user wants to trigger a code review:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "PR created. Run a code review before merge?"
  options:
    - label: "Skip review"
      description: "PR is ready — merge when CI passes"
    - label: "Self-review"
      description: "I'll review the diff in the PR myself"
    - label: "Request review"
      description: "Request review from a teammate"
```

**If "Request review":**
```bash
gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --add-reviewer "${REVIEWER}"
```

**If "Self-review":**
Report the PR URL and suggest: "Review the diff at {url}/files"
</step>

<step name="track_shipping">
Update STATE.md to reflect the shipping action:

```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state update "Last Activity" "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state update "Status" "Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} shipped — PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
```

If `commit_docs` is true:
```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs(${padded_phase}): ship phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} — PR #${PR_NUMBER}" --files .planning/STATE.md
```
</step>

<step name="report">
```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ✓ Phase {X}: {Name} — Shipped

PR: #{number} ({url})
Branch: {branch} → main
Commits: {count}
Verification: ✓ Passed
Requirements: {N} REQ-IDs addressed

Next steps:
- Review/approve PR
- Merge when CI passes
- $gsd-complete-milestone (if last phase in milestone)
- $gsd-progress (to see what's next)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

</step>

</process>

<offer_next>
After shipping:

- $gsd-complete-milestone — if all phases in milestone are done
- $gsd-progress — see overall project state
- $gsd-execute-phase {next} — continue to next phase
</offer_next>
