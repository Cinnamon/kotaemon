<purpose>
Orchestrate the full developer profiling flow: consent, session analysis (or questionnaire fallback), profile generation, result display, and artifact creation.

This workflow wires Phase 1 (session pipeline) and Phase 2 (profiling engine) into a cohesive user-facing experience. All heavy lifting is done by existing gsd-tools.cjs subcommands and the gsd-user-profiler agent -- this workflow orchestrates the sequence, handles branching, and provides the UX.

## 1. Initialize

Parse flags from {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- Detect `--questionnaire` flag (skip session analysis, questionnaire-only)
- Detect `--refresh` flag (rebuild profile even when one exists)

Check for existing profile:

```bash
PROFILE_PATH="/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md"
[ -f "$PROFILE_PATH" ] && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

**If profile exists AND --refresh NOT set AND --questionnaire NOT set:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Existing Profile"
- question: "You already have a profile. What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - "View it" -- Display summary card from existing profile data, then exit
  - "Refresh it" -- Continue with --refresh behavior
  - "Cancel" -- Exit workflow

If "View it": Read USER-PROFILE.md, display its content formatted as a summary card, then exit.
If "Refresh it": Set --refresh behavior and continue.
If "Cancel": Display "No changes made." and exit.

**If profile exists AND --refresh IS set:**

Backup existing profile:
```bash
cp "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md" "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.backup.md"
```

Display: "Re-analyzing your sessions to update your profile."
Continue to step 2.

**If no profile exists:** Continue to step 2.

---

## 2. Consent Gate (ACTV-06)

**Skip if** `--questionnaire` flag is set (no JSONL reading occurs -- jump directly to step 4b).

Display consent screen:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD > PROFILE YOUR CODING STYLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

the agent starts every conversation generic. A profile teaches the agent
how YOU actually work -- not how you think you work.

## What We'll Analyze

Your recent Claude Code sessions, looking for patterns in these
8 behavioral dimensions:

| Dimension            | What It Measures                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Communication Style  | How you phrase requests (terse vs. detailed) |
| Decision Speed       | How you choose between options               |
| Explanation Depth    | How much explanation you want with code      |
| Debugging Approach   | How you tackle errors and bugs               |
| UX Philosophy        | How much you care about design vs. function  |
| Vendor Philosophy    | How you evaluate libraries and tools         |
| Frustration Triggers | What makes you correct the agent                |
| Learning Style       | How you prefer to learn new things           |

## Data Handling

✓ Reads session files locally (read-only, nothing modified)
✓ Analyzes message patterns (not content meaning)
✓ Stores profile at /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md
✗ Nothing is sent to external services
✗ Sensitive content (API keys, passwords) is automatically excluded
```

**If --refresh path:**
Show abbreviated consent instead:

```
Re-analyzing your sessions to update your profile.
Your existing profile has been backed up to USER-PROFILE.backup.md.
```

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Refresh"
- question: "Continue with profile refresh?"
- options:
  - "Continue" -- Proceed to step 3
  - "Cancel" -- Exit workflow

**If default (no --refresh) path:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Ready?"
- question: "Ready to analyze your sessions?"
- options:
  - "Let's go" -- Proceed to step 3 (session analysis)
  - "Use questionnaire instead" -- Jump to step 4b (questionnaire path)
  - "Not now" -- Display "No worries. Run $gsd-profile-user when ready." and exit

---

## 3. Session Scan

Display: "◆ Scanning sessions..."

Run session scan:
```bash
SCAN_RESULT=$(node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs scan-sessions --json 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse the JSON output to get session count and project count.

Display: "✓ Found N sessions across M projects"

**Determine data sufficiency:**
- Count total messages available from the scan result (sum sessions across projects)
- If 0 sessions found: Display "No sessions found. Switching to questionnaire." and jump to step 4b
- If sessions found: Continue to step 4a

---

## 4a. Session Analysis Path

Display: "◆ Sampling messages..."

Run profile sampling:
```bash
SAMPLE_RESULT=$(node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs profile-sample --json 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse the JSON output to get the temp directory path and message count.

Display: "✓ Sampled N messages from M projects"

Display: "◆ Analyzing patterns..."

**Spawn gsd-user-profiler agent using Task tool:**

Use the Task tool to spawn the `gsd-user-profiler` agent. Provide it with:
- The sampled JSONL file path from profile-sample output
- The user-profiling reference doc at `/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/references/user-profiling.md`

The agent prompt should follow this structure:
```
Read the profiling reference document and the sampled session messages, then analyze the developer's behavioral patterns across all 8 dimensions.

Reference: @/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/references/user-profiling.md
Session data: @{temp_dir}/profile-sample.jsonl

Analyze these messages and return your analysis in the <analysis> JSON format specified in the reference document.
```

**Parse the agent's output:**
- Extract the `<analysis>` JSON block from the agent's response
- Save analysis JSON to a temp file (in the same temp directory created by profile-sample)

```bash
ANALYSIS_PATH="{temp_dir}/analysis.json"
```

Write the analysis JSON to `$ANALYSIS_PATH`.

Display: "✓ Analysis complete (N dimensions scored)"

**Check for thin data:**
- Read the analysis JSON and check the total message count
- If < 50 messages were analyzed: Note that a questionnaire supplement could improve accuracy. Display: "Note: Limited session data (N messages). Results may have lower confidence."

Continue to step 5.

---

## 4b. Questionnaire Path

Display: "Using questionnaire to build your profile."

**Get questions:**
```bash
QUESTIONS=$(node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs profile-questionnaire --json 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse the questions JSON. It contains 8 questions, one per dimension.

**Present each question to the user via AskUserQuestion:**

For each question in the questions array:
- header: The dimension name (e.g., "Communication Style")
- question: The question text
- options: The answer options from the question definition

Collect all answers into an answers JSON object mapping dimension keys to selected answer values.

**Save answers to temp file:**
```bash
ANSWERS_PATH=$(mktemp /tmp/gsd-profile-answers-XXXXXX.json)
```

Write the answers JSON to `$ANSWERS_PATH`.

**Convert answers to analysis:**
```bash
ANALYSIS_RESULT=$(node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs profile-questionnaire --answers "$ANSWERS_PATH" --json 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse the analysis JSON from the result.

Save analysis JSON to a temp file:
```bash
ANALYSIS_PATH=$(mktemp /tmp/gsd-profile-analysis-XXXXXX.json)
```

Write the analysis JSON to `$ANALYSIS_PATH`.

Continue to step 5 (skip split resolution since questionnaire handles ambiguity internally).

---

## 5. Split Resolution

**Skip if** questionnaire-only path (splits already handled internally).

Read the analysis JSON from `$ANALYSIS_PATH`.

Check each dimension for `cross_project_consistent: false`.

**For each split detected:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: The dimension name (e.g., "Communication Style")
- question: "Your sessions show different patterns:" followed by the split context (e.g., "CLI/backend projects -> terse-direct, Frontend/UI projects -> detailed-structured")
- options:
  - Rating option A (e.g., "terse-direct")
  - Rating option B (e.g., "detailed-structured")
  - "Context-dependent (keep both)"

**If user picks a specific rating:** Update the dimension's `rating` field in the analysis JSON to the selected value.

**If user picks "Context-dependent":** Keep the dominant rating in the `rating` field. Add a `context_note` to the dimension's summary describing the split (e.g., "Context-dependent: terse in CLI projects, detailed in frontend projects").

Write updated analysis JSON back to `$ANALYSIS_PATH`.

---

## 6. Profile Write

Display: "◆ Writing profile..."

```bash
node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs write-profile --input "$ANALYSIS_PATH" --json 2>/dev/null
```

Display: "✓ Profile written to /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md"

---

## 7. Result Display

Read the analysis JSON from `$ANALYSIS_PATH` to build the display.

**Show report card table:**

```
## Your Profile

| Dimension            | Rating               | Confidence |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Communication Style  | detailed-structured  | HIGH       |
| Decision Speed       | deliberate-informed  | MEDIUM     |
| Explanation Depth    | concise              | HIGH       |
| Debugging Approach   | hypothesis-driven    | MEDIUM     |
| UX Philosophy        | pragmatic            | LOW        |
| Vendor Philosophy    | thorough-evaluator   | HIGH       |
| Frustration Triggers | scope-creep          | MEDIUM     |
| Learning Style       | self-directed        | HIGH       |
```

(Populate with actual values from the analysis JSON.)

**Show highlight reel:**

Pick 3-4 dimensions with the highest confidence and most evidence signals. Format as:

```
## Highlights

- **Communication (HIGH):** You consistently provide structured context with
  headers and problem statements before making requests
- **Vendor Choices (HIGH):** You research alternatives thoroughly -- comparing
  docs, GitHub activity, and bundle sizes before committing
- **Frustrations (MEDIUM):** You correct the agent most often for doing things
  you didn't ask for -- scope creep is your primary trigger
```

Build highlights from the `evidence` array and `summary` fields in the analysis JSON. Use the most compelling evidence quotes. Format each as "You tend to..." or "You consistently..." with evidence attribution.

**Offer full profile view:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Profile"
- question: "Want to see the full profile?"
- options:
  - "Yes" -- Read and display the full USER-PROFILE.md content, then continue to step 8
  - "Continue to artifacts" -- Proceed directly to step 8

---

## 8. Artifact Selection (ACTV-05)

Use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect:
- header: "Artifacts"
- question: "Which artifacts should I generate?"
- options (ALL pre-selected by default):
  - "$gsd-dev-preferences command file" -- "Load your preferences in any session"
  - "AGENTS.md profile section" -- "Add profile to this project's AGENTS.md"
  - "Global AGENTS.md" -- "Add profile to /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/AGENTS.md for all projects"

**If no artifacts selected:** Display "No artifacts generated. Your profile is saved at /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md" and jump to step 10.

---

## 9. Artifact Generation

Generate selected artifacts sequentially (file I/O is fast, no benefit from parallel agents):

**For $gsd-dev-preferences (if selected):**

```bash
node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs generate-dev-preferences --analysis "$ANALYSIS_PATH" --json 2>/dev/null
```

Display: "✓ Generated $gsd-dev-preferences at /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/commands/gsd/dev-preferences.md"

**For AGENTS.md profile section (if selected):**

```bash
node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs generate-claude-profile --analysis "$ANALYSIS_PATH" --json 2>/dev/null
```

Display: "✓ Added profile section to AGENTS.md"

**For Global AGENTS.md (if selected):**

```bash
node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs generate-claude-profile --analysis "$ANALYSIS_PATH" --global --json 2>/dev/null
```

Display: "✓ Added profile section to /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/AGENTS.md"

**Error handling:** If any gsd-tools.cjs call fails, display the error message and use AskUserQuestion to offer "Retry" or "Skip this artifact". On retry, re-run the command. On skip, continue to next artifact.

---

## 10. Summary & Refresh Diff

**If --refresh path:**

Read both old backup and new analysis to compare dimension ratings/confidence.

Read the backed-up profile:
```bash
BACKUP_PATH="/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.backup.md"
```

Compare each dimension's rating and confidence between old and new. Display diff table showing only changed dimensions:

```
## Changes

| Dimension       | Before                      | After                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Communication   | terse-direct (LOW)          | detailed-structured (HIGH)  |
| Debugging       | fix-first (MEDIUM)          | hypothesis-driven (MEDIUM)  |
```

If nothing changed: Display "No changes detected -- your profile is already up to date."

**Display final summary:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD > PROFILE COMPLETE ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your profile:    /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md
```

Then list paths for each generated artifact:
```
Artifacts:
  ✓ $gsd-dev-preferences   /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/commands/gsd/dev-preferences.md
  ✓ AGENTS.md section       ./AGENTS.md
  ✓ Global AGENTS.md        /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

(Only show artifacts that were actually generated.)

**Clean up temp files:**

Remove the temp directory created by profile-sample (contains sample JSONL and analysis JSON):
```bash
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

Also remove any standalone temp files created for questionnaire answers:
```bash
rm -f "$ANSWERS_PATH" 2>/dev/null
rm -f "$ANALYSIS_PATH" 2>/dev/null
```

(Only clean up temp paths that were actually created during this workflow run.)
