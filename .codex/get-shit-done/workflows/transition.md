<internal_workflow>

**This is an INTERNAL workflow — NOT a user-facing command.**

There is no `$gsd-transition` command. This workflow is invoked automatically by
`execute-phase` during auto-advance, or inline by the orchestrator after phase
verification. Users should never be told to run `$gsd-transition`.

**Valid user commands for phase progression:**
- `$gsd-discuss-phase {N}` — discuss a phase before planning
- `$gsd-plan-phase {N}` — plan a phase
- `$gsd-execute-phase {N}` — execute a phase
- `$gsd-progress` — see roadmap progress

</internal_workflow>

<required_reading>

**Read these files NOW:**

1. `.planning/STATE.md`
2. `.planning/PROJECT.md`
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
4. Current phase's plan files (`*-PLAN.md`)
5. Current phase's summary files (`*-SUMMARY.md`)

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Mark current phase complete and advance to next. This is the natural point where progress tracking and PROJECT.md evolution happen.

"Planning next phase" = "current phase is done"

</purpose>

<process>

<step name="load_project_state" priority="first">

Before transition, read project state:

```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Parse current position to verify we're transitioning the right phase.
Note accumulated context that may need updating after transition.

</step>

<step name="verify_completion">

Check current phase has all plan summaries:

```bash
(ls .planning/phases/XX-current/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
(ls .planning/phases/XX-current/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
```

**Verification logic:**

- Count PLAN files
- Count SUMMARY files
- If counts match: all plans complete
- If counts don't match: incomplete

<config-check>

```bash
cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

</config-check>

**Check for verification debt in this phase:**

```bash
# Count outstanding items in current phase
OUTSTANDING=""
for f in .planning/phases/XX-current/*-UAT.md .planning/phases/XX-current/*-VERIFICATION.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  grep -q "result: pending\|result: blocked\|status: partial\|status: human_needed\|status: diagnosed" "$f" && OUTSTANDING="$OUTSTANDING\n$(basename $f)"
done
```

**If OUTSTANDING is not empty:**

Append to the completion confirmation message (regardless of mode):

```
Outstanding verification items in this phase:
{list filenames}

These will carry forward as debt. Review: `$gsd-audit-uat`
```

This does NOT block transition — it ensures the user sees the debt before confirming.

**If all plans complete:**

<if mode="yolo">

```
⚡ Auto-approved: Transition Phase [X] → Phase [X+1]
Phase [X] complete — all [Y] plans finished.

Proceeding to mark done and advance...
```

Proceed directly to cleanup_handoff step.

</if>

<if mode="interactive" OR="custom with gates.confirm_transition true">

Ask: "Phase [X] complete — all [Y] plans finished. Ready to mark done and move to Phase [X+1]?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

</if>

**If plans incomplete:**

**SAFETY RAIL: always_confirm_destructive applies here.**
Skipping incomplete plans is destructive — ALWAYS prompt regardless of mode.

Present:

```
Phase [X] has incomplete plans:
- {phase}-01-SUMMARY.md ✓ Complete
- {phase}-02-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing
- {phase}-03-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing

⚠️ Safety rail: Skipping plans requires confirmation (destructive action)

Options:
1. Continue current phase (execute remaining plans)
2. Mark complete anyway (skip remaining plans)
3. Review what's left
```

Wait for user decision.

</step>

<step name="cleanup_handoff">

Check for lingering handoffs:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/XX-current/.continue-here*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

If found, delete them — phase is complete, handoffs are stale.

</step>

<step name="update_roadmap_and_state">

**Delegate ROADMAP.md and STATE.md updates to gsd-tools:**

```bash
TRANSITION=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" phase complete "${current_phase}")
```

The CLI handles:
- Marking the phase checkbox as `[x]` complete with today's date
- Updating plan count to final (e.g., "3/3 plans complete")
- Updating the Progress table (Status → Complete, adding date)
- Advancing STATE.md to next phase (Current Phase, Status → Ready to plan, Current Plan → Not started)
- Detecting if this is the last phase in the milestone

Extract from result: `completed_phase`, `plans_executed`, `next_phase`, `next_phase_name`, `is_last_phase`.

</step>

<step name="archive_prompts">

If prompts were generated for the phase, they stay in place.
The `completed/` subfolder pattern from create-meta-prompts handles archival.

</step>

<step name="evolve_project">

Evolve PROJECT.md to reflect learnings from completed phase.

**Read phase summaries:**

```bash
cat .planning/phases/XX-current/*-SUMMARY.md
```

**Assess requirement changes:**

1. **Requirements validated?**
   - Any Active requirements shipped in this phase?
   - Move to Validated with phase reference: `- ✓ [Requirement] — Phase X`

2. **Requirements invalidated?**
   - Any Active requirements discovered to be unnecessary or wrong?
   - Move to Out of Scope with reason: `- [Requirement] — [why invalidated]`

3. **Requirements emerged?**
   - Any new requirements discovered during building?
   - Add to Active: `- [ ] [New requirement]`

4. **Decisions to log?**
   - Extract decisions from SUMMARY.md files
   - Add to Key Decisions table with outcome if known

5. **"What This Is" still accurate?**
   - If the product has meaningfully changed, update the description
   - Keep it current and accurate

**Update PROJECT.md:**

Make the edits inline. Update "Last updated" footer:

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after Phase [X]*
```

**Example evolution:**

Before:

```markdown
### Active

- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] Offline mode

### Out of Scope

- OAuth2 — complexity not needed for v1
```

After (Phase 2 shipped JWT auth, discovered rate limiting needed):

```markdown
### Validated

- ✓ JWT authentication — Phase 2

### Active

- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] Rate limiting on sync endpoint

### Out of Scope

- OAuth2 — complexity not needed for v1
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase summaries reviewed for learnings
- [ ] Validated requirements moved from Active
- [ ] Invalidated requirements moved to Out of Scope with reason
- [ ] Emerged requirements added to Active
- [ ] New decisions logged with rationale
- [ ] "What This Is" updated if product changed
- [ ] "Last updated" footer reflects this transition

</step>

<step name="update_current_position_after_transition">

**Note:** Basic position updates (Current Phase, Status, Current Plan, Last Activity) were already handled by `gsd-tools phase complete` in the update_roadmap_and_state step.

Verify the updates are correct by reading STATE.md. If the progress bar needs updating, use:

```bash
PROGRESS=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" progress bar --raw)
```

Update the progress bar line in STATE.md with the result.

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase number incremented to next phase (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Plan status reset to "Not started" (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Status shows "Ready to plan" (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Progress bar reflects total completed plans

</step>

<step name="update_project_reference">

Update Project Reference section in STATE.md.

```markdown
## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [today])

**Core value:** [Current core value from PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** [Next phase name]
```

Update the date and current focus to reflect the transition.

</step>

<step name="review_accumulated_context">

Review and update Accumulated Context section in STATE.md.

**Decisions:**

- Note recent decisions from this phase (3-5 max)
- Full log lives in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table

**Blockers/Concerns:**

- Review blockers from completed phase
- If addressed in this phase: Remove from list
- If still relevant for future: Keep with "Phase X" prefix
- Add any new concerns from completed phase's summaries

**Example:**

Before:

```markdown
### Blockers/Concerns

- ⚠️ [Phase 1] Database schema not indexed for common queries
- ⚠️ [Phase 2] WebSocket reconnection behavior on flaky networks unknown
```

After (if database indexing was addressed in Phase 2):

```markdown
### Blockers/Concerns

- ⚠️ [Phase 2] WebSocket reconnection behavior on flaky networks unknown
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Recent decisions noted (full log in PROJECT.md)
- [ ] Resolved blockers removed from list
- [ ] Unresolved blockers kept with phase prefix
- [ ] New concerns from completed phase added

</step>

<step name="update_session_continuity_after_transition">

Update Session Continuity section in STATE.md to reflect transition completion.

**Format:**

```markdown
Last session: [today]
Stopped at: Phase [X] complete, ready to plan Phase [X+1]
Resume file: None
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Last session timestamp updated to current date and time
- [ ] Stopped at describes phase completion and next phase
- [ ] Resume file confirmed as None (transitions don't use resume files)

</step>

<step name="offer_next_phase">

**MANDATORY: Verify milestone status before presenting next steps.**

**Use the transition result from `gsd-tools phase complete`:**

The `is_last_phase` field from the phase complete result tells you directly:
- `is_last_phase: false` → More phases remain → Go to **Route A**
- `is_last_phase: true` → Last phase done → **Check for workstream collisions first**

The `next_phase` and `next_phase_name` fields give you the next phase details.

If you need additional context, use:
```bash
ROADMAP=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" roadmap analyze)
```

This returns all phases with goals, disk status, and completion info.

---

**Workstream collision check (when `is_last_phase: true`):**

Before routing to Route B, check whether other workstreams are still active.
This prevents one workstream from advancing or completing the milestone while
other workstreams are still working on their phases.

**Skip this check if NOT in workstream mode** (i.e., `GSD_WORKSTREAM` is not set / flat mode).
In flat mode, go directly to **Route B**.

```bash
# Only check if we're in workstream mode
if [ -n "$GSD_WORKSTREAM" ]; then
  WS_LIST=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" workstream list --raw)
fi
```

Parse the JSON result. The output has `{ mode, workstreams: [...] }`.
Each workstream entry has: `name`, `status`, `current_phase`, `phase_count`, `completed_phases`.

Filter out the current workstream (`$GSD_WORKSTREAM`) and any workstreams with
status containing "milestone complete" or "archived" (case-insensitive).
The remaining entries are **other active workstreams**.

- **If other active workstreams exist** → Go to **Route B1**
- **If NO other active workstreams** (or flat mode) → Go to **Route B**

---

**Route A: More phases remain in milestone**

Read ROADMAP.md to get the next phase's name and goal.

**Check if next phase has CONTEXT.md:**

```bash
ls .planning/phases/*[X+1]*/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If next phase exists:**

<if mode="yolo">

**If CONTEXT.md exists:**

```
Phase [X] marked complete.

**Route B1: Workstream done, other workstreams still active**

This route is reached when `is_last_phase: true` AND the collision check found
other active workstreams. Do NOT suggest completing the milestone or advancing
to the next milestone — other workstreams are still working.

**Clear auto-advance chain flag** — workstream boundary is the natural stopping point:

```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow._auto_chain_active false
```

<if mode="yolo">

Override auto-advance: do NOT auto-continue to milestone completion.
Present the blocking information and stop.

</if>

Present (all modes):

```
## ✓ Phase {X}: {Phase Name} Complete

This workstream's phases are complete. Other workstreams are still active:

| Workstream | Status | Phase | Progress |
|------------|--------|-------|----------|

## Next Steps

Archive this workstream:

`$gsd-workstreams complete {current_ws_name} ${GSD_WS}`

See overall milestone progress:

`$gsd-workstreams progress ${GSD_WS}`

<implicit_tracking>
Progress tracking is IMPLICIT: planning phase N implies phases 1-(N-1) complete. No separate progress step—forward motion IS progress.
</implicit_tracking>

<partial_completion>

If user wants to move on but phase isn't fully complete:

```
Phase [X] has incomplete plans:
- {phase}-02-PLAN.md (not executed)
- {phase}-03-PLAN.md (not executed)

Options:
1. Mark complete anyway (plans weren't needed)
2. Defer work to later phase
3. Stay and finish current phase
```

Respect user judgment — they know if work matters.

**If marking complete with incomplete plans:**

- Update ROADMAP: "2/3 plans complete" (not "3/3")
- Note in transition message which plans were skipped

</partial_completion>
