# GSD Command Reference

**GSD** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `$gsd-new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)
2. `$gsd-plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
3. `$gsd-execute-phase 1` - Execute the phase

## Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```
$gsd-new-project → $gsd-plan-phase → $gsd-execute-phase → repeat
```

### Project Initialization

**`$gsd-new-project`**
Initialize new project through unified flow.

One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:
- Deep questioning to understand what you're building
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria

Creates all `.planning/` artifacts:
- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements
- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
- `research/` — domain research (if selected)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements
- `STATE.md` — project memory

Usage: `$gsd-new-project`

**`$gsd-map-codebase`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `$gsd-new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `$gsd-map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`$gsd-discuss-phase <number>`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel
- Optional `--batch` asks 2-5 related questions at a time instead of one-by-one

Usage: `$gsd-discuss-phase 2`
Usage: `$gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch`
Usage: `$gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch=3`

**`$gsd-research-phase <number>`**
Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains.

- Discovers standard stack, architecture patterns, pitfalls
- Creates RESEARCH.md with "how experts build this" knowledge
- Use for 3D, games, audio, shaders, ML, and other specialized domains
- Goes beyond "which library" to ecosystem knowledge

Usage: `$gsd-research-phase 3`

**`$gsd-list-phase-assumptions <number>`**
See what the agent is planning to do before it starts.

- Shows the agent's intended approach for a phase
- Lets you course-correct if the agent misunderstood your vision
- No files created - conversational output only

Usage: `$gsd-list-phase-assumptions 3`

**`$gsd-plan-phase <number>`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `$gsd-plan-phase 1`
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

**PRD Express Path:** Pass `--prd path/to/requirements.md` to skip discuss-phase entirely. Your PRD becomes locked decisions in CONTEXT.md. Useful when you already have clear acceptance criteria.

### Execution

**`$gsd-execute-phase <phase-number>`**
Execute all plans in a phase, or run a specific wave.

- Groups plans by wave (from frontmatter), executes waves sequentially
- Plans within each wave run in parallel via Task tool
- Optional `--wave N` flag executes only Wave `N` and stops unless the phase is now fully complete
- Verifies phase goal after all plans complete
- Updates REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md

Usage: `$gsd-execute-phase 5`
Usage: `$gsd-execute-phase 5 --wave 2`

### Smart Router

**`$gsd-do <description>`**
Route freeform text to the right GSD command automatically.

- Analyzes natural language input to find the best matching GSD command
- Acts as a dispatcher — never does the work itself
- Resolves ambiguity by asking you to pick between top matches
- Use when you know what you want but don't know which `/gsd:*` command to run

Usage: `$gsd-do fix the login button`
Usage: `$gsd-do refactor the auth system`
Usage: `$gsd-do I want to start a new milestone`

### Quick Mode

**`$gsd-quick [--full] [--discuss] [--research]`**
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents.

Quick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier by default)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)

Flags enable additional quality steps:
- `--discuss` — Lightweight discussion to surface gray areas before planning
- `--research` — Focused research agent investigates approaches before planning
- `--full` — Adds plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification

Flags are composable: `--discuss --research --full` gives the complete quality pipeline for a single task.

Usage: `$gsd-quick`
Usage: `$gsd-quick --research --full`
Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/SUMMARY.md`

---

**`$gsd-fast [description]`**
Execute a trivial task inline — no subagents, no planning files, no overhead.

For tasks too small to justify planning: typo fixes, config changes, forgotten commits, simple additions. Runs in the current context, makes the change, commits, and logs to STATE.md.

- No PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md created
- No subagent spawned (runs inline)
- ≤ 3 file edits — redirects to `$gsd-quick` if task is non-trivial
- Atomic commit with conventional message

Usage: `$gsd-fast "fix the typo in README"`
Usage: `$gsd-fast "add .env to gitignore"`

### Roadmap Management

**`$gsd-add-phase <description>`**
Add new phase to end of current milestone.

- Appends to ROADMAP.md
- Uses next sequential number
- Updates phase directory structure

Usage: `$gsd-add-phase "Add admin dashboard"`

**`$gsd-insert-phase <after> <description>`**
Insert urgent work as decimal phase between existing phases.

- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)
- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `$gsd-insert-phase 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

**`$gsd-remove-phase <number>`**
Remove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

- Deletes phase directory and all references
- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap
- Only works on future (unstarted) phases
- Git commit preserves historical record

Usage: `$gsd-remove-phase 17`
Result: Phase 17 deleted, phases 18-20 become 17-19

### Milestone Management

**`$gsd-new-milestone <name>`**
Start a new milestone through unified flow.

- Deep questioning to understand what you're building next
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with scoping

## Workflow Modes

Set during `$gsd-new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Planning Configuration

Configure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:

**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)
- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)
- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed

When `commit_docs: false`:
- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`
- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private
- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git

**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)
- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches
- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it

Example config:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "search_gitignored": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```
$gsd-new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
/clear
$gsd-plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase
/clear
$gsd-execute-phase 1    # Execute all plans in phase
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```
$gsd-progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```
$gsd-insert-phase 5 "Critical security fix"
$gsd-plan-phase 5.1
$gsd-execute-phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```
$gsd-complete-milestone 1.0.0
/clear
$gsd-new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```
$gsd-add-todo                    # Capture from conversation context
$gsd-add-todo Fix modal z-index  # Capture with explicit description
$gsd-check-todos                 # Review and work on todos
$gsd-check-todos api             # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```
$gsd-debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
$gsd-debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `$gsd-progress` to check where you're up to
