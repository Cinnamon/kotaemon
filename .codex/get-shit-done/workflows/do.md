<purpose>
Analyze freeform text from the user and route to the most appropriate GSD command. This is a dispatcher — it never does the work itself. Match user intent to the best command, confirm the routing, and hand off.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<process>

<step name="validate">
**Check for input.**

If `{{GSD_ARGS}}` is empty, ask via AskUserQuestion:

```
What would you like to do? Describe the task, bug, or idea and I'll route it to the right GSD command.
```

Wait for response before continuing.
</step>

<step name="check_project">
**Check if project exists.**

```bash
INIT=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state load 2>/dev/null)
```

Track whether `.planning/` exists — some routes require it, others don't.
</step>

<step name="route">
**Match intent to command.**

Evaluate `{{GSD_ARGS}}` against these routing rules. Apply the **first matching** rule:

| If the text describes... | Route to | Why |
|--------------------------|----------|-----|
| Starting a new project, "set up", "initialize" | `$gsd-new-project` | Needs full project initialization |
| Mapping or analyzing an existing codebase | `$gsd-map-codebase` | Codebase discovery |
| A bug, error, crash, failure, or something broken | `$gsd-debug` | Needs systematic investigation |
| Exploring, researching, comparing, or "how does X work" | `$gsd-research-phase` | Domain research before planning |
| Discussing vision, "how should X look", brainstorming | `$gsd-discuss-phase` | Needs context gathering |
| A complex task: refactoring, migration, multi-file architecture, system redesign | `$gsd-add-phase` | Needs a full phase with plan/build cycle |
| Planning a specific phase or "plan phase N" | `$gsd-plan-phase` | Direct planning request |
| Executing a phase or "build phase N", "run phase N" | `$gsd-execute-phase` | Direct execution request |
| Running all remaining phases automatically | `$gsd-autonomous` | Full autonomous execution |
| A review or quality concern about existing work | `$gsd-verify-work` | Needs verification |
| Checking progress, status, "where am I" | `$gsd-progress` | Status check |
| Resuming work, "pick up where I left off" | `$gsd-resume-work` | Session restoration |
| A note, idea, or "remember to..." | `$gsd-add-todo` | Capture for later |
| Adding tests, "write tests", "test coverage" | `$gsd-add-tests` | Test generation |
| Completing a milestone, shipping, releasing | `$gsd-complete-milestone` | Milestone lifecycle |
| A specific, actionable, small task (add feature, fix typo, update config) | `$gsd-quick` | Self-contained, single executor |

**Requires `.planning/` directory:** All routes except `$gsd-new-project`, `$gsd-map-codebase`, `$gsd-help`, and `$gsd-join-discord`. If the project doesn't exist and the route requires it, suggest `$gsd-new-project` first.

**Ambiguity handling:** If the text could reasonably match multiple routes, ask the user via AskUserQuestion with the top 2-3 options. For example:

```
"Refactor the authentication system" could be:
1. $gsd-add-phase — Full planning cycle (recommended for multi-file refactors)
2. $gsd-quick — Quick execution (if scope is small and clear)

Which approach fits better?
```
</step>

<step name="display">
**Show the routing decision.**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► ROUTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Input:** {first 80 chars of {{GSD_ARGS}}}
**Routing to:** {chosen command}
**Reason:** {one-line explanation}
```
</step>

<step name="dispatch">
**Invoke the chosen command.**

Run the selected `/gsd:*` command, passing `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as args.

If the chosen command expects a phase number and one wasn't provided in the text, extract it from context or ask via AskUserQuestion.

After invoking the command, stop. The dispatched command handles everything from here.
</step>
