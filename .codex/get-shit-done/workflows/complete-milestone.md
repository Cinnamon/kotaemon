<purpose>

Mark a shipped version (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) as complete. Creates historical record in MILESTONES.md, performs full PROJECT.md evolution review, reorganizes ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, and tags the release in git.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

1. templates/milestone.md
2. templates/milestone-archive.md
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
4. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
5. `.planning/PROJECT.md`

</required_reading>

<archival_behavior>

When a milestone completes:

1. Extract full milestone details to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
2. Archive requirements to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Update ROADMAP.md — replace milestone details with one-line summary
4. Delete REQUIREMENTS.md (fresh one for next milestone)
5. Perform full PROJECT.md evolution review
6. Offer to create next milestone inline
7. Archive UI artifacts (`*-UI-SPEC.md`, `*-UI-REVIEW.md`) alongside other phase documents
8. Clean up `.planning/ui-reviews/` screenshot files (binary assets, never archived)

**Context Efficiency:** Archives keep ROADMAP.md constant-size and REQUIREMENTS.md milestone-scoped.

**ROADMAP archive** uses `templates/milestone-archive.md` — includes milestone header (status, phases, date), full phase details, milestone summary (decisions, issues, tech debt).

**REQUIREMENTS archive** contains all requirements marked complete with outcomes, traceability table with final status, notes on changed requirements.

</archival_behavior>

<process>

<step name="verify_readiness">

**Use `roadmap analyze` for comprehensive readiness check:**

```bash
ROADMAP=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" roadmap analyze)
```

This returns all phases with plan/summary counts and disk status. Use this to verify:
- Which phases belong to this milestone?
- All phases complete (all plans have summaries)? Check `disk_status === 'complete'` for each.
- `progress_percent` should be 100%.

**Requirements completion check (REQUIRED before presenting):**

Parse REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table:
- Count total v1 requirements vs checked-off (`[x]`) requirements
- Identify any non-Complete rows in the traceability table

Present:

```
Milestone: [Name, e.g., "v1.0 MVP"]

Includes:
- Phase 1: Foundation (2/2 plans complete)
- Phase 2: Authentication (2/2 plans complete)
- Phase 3: Core Features (3/3 plans complete)
- Phase 4: Polish (1/1 plan complete)

Total: {phase_count} phases, {total_plans} plans, all complete
Requirements: {N}/{M} v1 requirements checked off
```

**If requirements incomplete** (N < M):

```
⚠ Unchecked Requirements:

- [ ] {REQ-ID}: {description} (Phase {X})
- [ ] {REQ-ID}: {description} (Phase {Y})
```

MUST present 3 options:
1. **Proceed anyway** — mark milestone complete with known gaps
2. **Run audit first** — `$gsd-audit-milestone` to assess gap severity
3. **Abort** — return to development

If user selects "Proceed anyway": note incomplete requirements in MILESTONES.md under `### Known Gaps` with REQ-IDs and descriptions.

<step name="extract_accomplishments">

Extract one-liners from SUMMARY.md files using summary-extract:

Key accomplishments for this milestone:
1. [Achievement from phase 1]
2. [Achievement from phase 2]
3. [Achievement from phase 3]
4. [Achievement from phase 4]
5. [Achievement from phase 5]

<step name="create_milestone_entry">

**Note:** MILESTONES.md entry is now created automatically by `gsd-tools milestone complete` in the archive_milestone step. The entry includes version, date, phase/plan/task counts, and accomplishments extracted from SUMMARY.md files.

If additional details are needed (e.g., user-provided "Delivered" summary, git range, LOC stats), add them manually after the CLI creates the base entry.

</step>

<step name="evolve_project_full_review">

Full PROJECT.md evolution review at milestone completion.

Read all phase summaries:

```bash
cat .planning/phases/*-*/*-SUMMARY.md
```

**Full review checklist:**

1. **"What This Is" accuracy:**
   - Compare current description to what was built
   - Update if product has meaningfully changed

2. **Core Value check:**
   - Still the right priority? Did shipping reveal a different core value?
   - Update if the ONE thing has shifted

3. **Requirements audit:**

   **Validated section:**
   - All Active requirements shipped this milestone → Move to Validated
   - Format: `- ✓ [Requirement] — v[X.Y]`

   **Active section:**
   - Remove requirements moved to Validated
   - Add new requirements for next milestone
   - Keep unaddressed requirements

   **Out of Scope audit:**
   - Review each item — reasoning still valid?
   - Remove irrelevant items
   - Add requirements invalidated during milestone

4. **Context update:**
   - Current codebase state (LOC, tech stack)
   - User feedback themes (if any)
   - Known issues or technical debt

5. **Key Decisions audit:**
   - Extract all decisions from milestone phase summaries
   - Add to Key Decisions table with outcomes
   - Mark ✓ Good, ⚠️ Revisit, or — Pending

6. **Constraints check:**
   - Any constraints changed during development? Update as needed

Update PROJECT.md inline. Update "Last updated" footer:

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after v[X.Y] milestone*
```

**Example full evolution (v1.0 → v1.1 prep):**

Before:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Canvas drawing tools
- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Export to PNG

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach
- Video chat — use external tools
```

After v1.0:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams with instant sync and drawing tools.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Canvas drawing tools — v1.0
- ✓ Real-time sync < 500ms — v1.0 (achieved 200ms avg)
- ✓ User authentication — v1.0

### Active

- [ ] Export to PNG
- [ ] Undo/redo history
- [ ] Shape tools (rectangles, circles)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach, PWA works well
- Video chat — use external tools
- Offline mode — real-time is core value

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 2,400 LOC TypeScript.
Tech stack: Next.js, Supabase, Canvas API.
Initial user testing showed demand for shape tools.
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] "What This Is" reviewed and updated if needed
- [ ] Core Value verified as still correct
- [ ] All shipped requirements moved to Validated
- [ ] New requirements added to Active for next milestone
- [ ] Out of Scope reasoning audited
- [ ] Context updated with current state
- [ ] All milestone decisions added to Key Decisions
- [ ] "Last updated" footer reflects milestone completion

<step name="archive_milestone">

**Delegate archival to gsd-tools:**

```bash
ARCHIVE=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" milestone complete "v[X.Y]" --name "[Milestone Name]")
```

The CLI handles:
- Creating `.planning/milestones/` directory
- Archiving ROADMAP.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
- Archiving REQUIREMENTS.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md` with archive header
- Moving audit file to milestones if it exists
- Creating/appending MILESTONES.md entry with accomplishments from SUMMARY.md files
- Updating STATE.md (status, last activity)

Extract from result: `version`, `date`, `phases`, `plans`, `tasks`, `accomplishments`, `archived`.

Verify: `✅ Milestone archived to .planning/milestones/`

**Phase archival (optional):** After archival completes, ask the user:

AskUserQuestion(header="Archive Phases", question="Archive phase directories to milestones/?", options: "Yes — move to milestones/v[X.Y]-phases/" | "Skip — keep phases in place")

If "Yes": move phase directories to the milestone archive:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-phases
# For each phase directory in .planning/phases/:
mv .planning/phases/{phase-dir} .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-phases/
```
Verify: `✅ Phase directories archived to .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-phases/`

If "Skip": Phase directories remain in `.planning/phases/` as raw execution history. Use `$gsd-cleanup` later to archive retroactively.

After archival, the AI still handles:
- Reorganizing ROADMAP.md with milestone grouping (requires judgment)
- Full PROJECT.md evolution review (requires understanding)
- Deleting original ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
- These are NOT fully delegated because they require AI interpretation of content

</step>

<step name="reorganize_roadmap_and_delete_originals">

After `milestone complete` has archived, reorganize ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, then delete originals:

**Reorganize ROADMAP.md** — group completed milestone phases:

```

**Then delete originals:**

```bash
rm .planning/ROADMAP.md
rm .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

</step>

<step name="write_retrospective">

**Append to living retrospective:**

Check for existing retrospective:
```bash
ls .planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If exists:** Read the file, append new milestone section before the "## Cross-Milestone Trends" section.

**If doesn't exist:** Create from template at `/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/templates/retrospective.md`.

**Gather retrospective data:**

1. From SUMMARY.md files: Extract key deliverables, one-liners, tech decisions
2. From VERIFICATION.md files: Extract verification scores, gaps found
3. From UAT.md files: Extract test results, issues found
4. From git log: Count commits, calculate timeline
5. From the milestone work: Reflect on what worked and what didn't

**Write the milestone section:**

```markdown
## Milestone: v{version} — {name}

**Shipped:** {date}
**Phases:** {phase_count} | **Plans:** {plan_count}

### What Was Built
{Extract from SUMMARY.md one-liners}

### What Worked
{Patterns that led to smooth execution}

### What Was Inefficient
{Missed opportunities, rework, bottlenecks}

### Patterns Established
{New conventions discovered during this milestone}

### Key Lessons
{Specific, actionable takeaways}

### Cost Observations
- Model mix: {X}% opus, {Y}% sonnet, {Z}% haiku
- Sessions: {count}
- Notable: {efficiency observation}
```

**Update cross-milestone trends:**

If the "## Cross-Milestone Trends" section exists, update the tables with new data from this milestone.

**Commit:**
```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: update retrospective for v${VERSION}" --files .planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [today])

**Core value:** [Current core value from PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** [Next milestone or "Planning next milestone"]
