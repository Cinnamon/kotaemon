<purpose>
Create structured `.planning/HANDOFF.json` and `.continue-here.md` handoff files to preserve complete work state across sessions. The JSON provides machine-readable state for `$gsd-resume-work`; the markdown provides human-readable context.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="detect">
Find current phase directory from most recently modified files:

```bash
# Find most recent phase directory with work
(ls -lt .planning/phases/*/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || true) | head -1 | grep -oP 'phases/\K[^/]+' || true
```

If no active phase detected, ask user which phase they're pausing work on.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which phase, which plan, which task
2. **Work completed**: What got done this session
3. **Work remaining**: What's left in current plan/phase
4. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
5. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
6. **Human actions pending**: Things that need manual intervention (MCP setup, API keys, approvals, manual testing)
7. **Background processes**: Any running servers/watchers that were part of the workflow
8. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed

Ask user for clarifications if needed via conversational questions.

**Also inspect SUMMARY.md files for false completions:**
```bash
# Check for placeholder content in existing summaries
grep -l "To be filled\|placeholder\|TBD" .planning/phases/*/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```
Report any summaries with placeholder content as incomplete items.

Be specific enough for a fresh the agent to understand immediately.

Use `current-timestamp` for last_updated field. You can use init todos (which provides timestamps) or call directly:
```bash
timestamp=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" current-timestamp full --raw)
```
</step>

<step name="commit">

```
</step>

✓ Handoff created:

Current state:

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .continue-here.md created in correct phase directory
