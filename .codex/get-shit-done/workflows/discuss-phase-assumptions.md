<purpose>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — using codebase-first analysis
and assumption surfacing instead of interview-style questioning.

You are a thinking partner, not an interviewer. Analyze the codebase deeply, surface what you
believe based on evidence, and ask the user only to correct what's wrong.
</purpose>

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsd-assumptions-analyzer — Analyzes codebase to surface implementation assumptions
</available_agent_types>

<downstream_awareness>
**CONTEXT.md feeds into:**

1. **gsd-phase-researcher** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT to research
2. **gsd-planner** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT decisions are locked

**Your job:** Capture decisions clearly enough that downstream agents can act on them
without asking the user again. Output is identical to discuss mode — same CONTEXT.md format.
</downstream_awareness>

<philosophy>
**Assumptions mode philosophy:**

The user is a visionary, not a codebase archaeologist. They need enough context to evaluate
whether your assumptions match their intent — not to answer questions you could figure out
by reading the code.

- Read the codebase FIRST, form opinions SECOND, ask ONLY about what's genuinely unclear
- Every assumption must cite evidence (file paths, patterns found)
- Every assumption must state consequences if wrong
- Minimize user interactions: ~2-4 corrections vs ~15-20 questions
</philosophy>

<scope_guardrail>
**CRITICAL: No scope creep.**

The phase boundary comes from ROADMAP.md and is FIXED. Discussion clarifies HOW to implement
what's scoped, never WHETHER to add new capabilities.

When user suggests scope creep:
"[Feature X] would be a new capability — that's its own phase.
Want me to note it for the roadmap backlog? For now, let's focus on [phase domain]."

Capture the idea in "Deferred Ideas". Don't lose it, don't act on it.
</scope_guardrail>

<answer_validation>
**IMPORTANT: Answer validation** — After every AskUserQuestion call, check if the response
is empty or whitespace-only. If so:
1. Retry the question once with the same parameters
2. If still empty, present the options as a plain-text numbered list

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):**
When text mode is active, do not use AskUserQuestion at all. Present every question as a
plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number.

<process>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Phase number from argument (required).

```bash
INIT=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init phase-op "${PHASE}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
AGENT_SKILLS_ANALYZER=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" agent-skills gsd-assumptions-analyzer 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse JSON for: `commit_docs`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`,
`phase_slug`, `padded_phase`, `has_research`, `has_context`, `has_plans`, `has_verification`,
`plan_count`, `roadmap_exists`, `planning_exists`.

**If `phase_found` is false:**
```
Phase [X] not found in roadmap.

Use $gsd-progress to see available phases.
```
Exit workflow.

**If `phase_found` is true:** Continue to check_existing.

**Auto mode** — If `--auto` is present in ARGUMENTS:
- In `check_existing`: auto-select "Update it" (if context exists) or continue without prompting
- In `present_assumptions`: skip confirmation gate, proceed directly to write CONTEXT.md
- In `correct_assumptions`: auto-select recommended option for each correction
- Log each auto-selected choice inline
- After completion, auto-advance to plan-phase
</step>

<step name="check_existing">
Check if CONTEXT.md already exists using `has_context` from init.

```bash
ls ${phase_dir}/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If exists:**

**If `--auto`:** Auto-select "Update it". Log: `[auto] Context exists — updating with assumption-based analysis.`

**Otherwise:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Context"
- question: "Phase [X] already has context. What do you want to do?"
- options:
  - "Update it" — Re-analyze codebase and refresh assumptions
  - "View it" — Show me what's there
  - "Skip" — Use existing context as-is

If "Update": Load existing, continue to load_prior_context
If "View": Display CONTEXT.md, then offer update/skip
If "Skip": Exit workflow

**If doesn't exist:**

Check `has_plans` and `plan_count` from init. **If `has_plans` is true:**

**If `--auto`:** Auto-select "Continue and replan after". Log: `[auto] Plans exist — continuing with assumption analysis, will replan after.`

**Otherwise:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Plans exist"
- question: "Phase [X] already has {plan_count} plan(s) created without user context. Your decisions here won't affect existing plans unless you replan."
- options:
  - "Continue and replan after"
  - "View existing plans"
  - "Cancel"

If "Continue and replan after": Continue to load_prior_context.
If "View existing plans": Display plan files, then offer "Continue" / "Cancel".
If "Cancel": Exit workflow.

**If `has_plans` is false:** Continue to load_prior_context.
</step>

<step name="load_prior_context">
Read project-level and prior phase context to avoid re-asking decided questions.

**Step 1: Read project-level files**
```bash
cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Extract from these:
- **PROJECT.md** — Vision, principles, non-negotiables, user preferences
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** — Acceptance criteria, constraints
- **STATE.md** — Current progress, any flags

**Step 2: Read all prior CONTEXT.md files**
```bash
(find .planning/phases -name "*-CONTEXT.md" 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
```

For each CONTEXT.md where phase number < current phase:
- Read the `<decisions>` section — these are locked preferences
- Read `<specifics>` — particular references or "I want it like X" moments
- Note patterns (e.g., "user consistently prefers minimal UI")

**Step 3: Build internal `<prior_decisions>` context**

Structure the extracted information for use in assumption generation.

**If no prior context exists:** Continue without — expected for early phases.
</step>

<step name="cross_reference_todos">
Check if any pending todos are relevant to this phase's scope.

```bash
TODO_MATCHES=$(node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" todo match-phase "${PHASE_NUMBER}")
```

Parse JSON for: `todo_count`, `matches[]`.

**If `todo_count` is 0:** Skip silently.

**If matches found:** Present matched todos, use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect) to fold relevant ones into scope.

**For selected (folded) todos:** Store as `<folded_todos>` for CONTEXT.md `<decisions>` section.
**For unselected:** Store as `<reviewed_todos>` for CONTEXT.md `<deferred>` section.

**Auto mode (`--auto`):** Fold all todos with score >= 0.4 automatically. Log the selection.
</step>

<step name="scout_codebase">
Lightweight scan of existing code to inform assumption generation.

**Step 1: Check for existing codebase maps**
```bash
ls .planning/codebase/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If codebase maps exist:** Read relevant ones (CONVENTIONS.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md). Extract reusable components, patterns, integration points. Skip to Step 3.

**Step 2: If no codebase maps, do targeted grep**

Extract key terms from phase goal, search for related files.

```bash
grep -rl "{term1}\|{term2}" src/ app/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Read the 3-5 most relevant files.

**Step 3: Build internal `<codebase_context>`**

Identify reusable assets, established patterns, integration points, and creative options. Store internally for use in deep_codebase_analysis.
</step>

<step name="deep_codebase_analysis">
Spawn a `gsd-assumptions-analyzer` agent to deeply analyze the codebase for this phase. This
keeps raw file contents out of the main context window, protecting token budget.

**Resolve calibration tier (if USER-PROFILE.md exists):**

```bash
PROFILE_PATH="/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md"
```

If file exists at PROFILE_PATH:
- Priority 1: Read config.json > preferences.vendor_philosophy (project-level override)
- Priority 2: Read USER-PROFILE.md Vendor Choices/Philosophy rating (global)
- Priority 3: Default to "standard"

Map to calibration tier:
- conservative OR thorough-evaluator → full_maturity (more alternatives, detailed evidence)
- opinionated → minimal_decisive (fewer alternatives, decisive recommendations)
- pragmatic-fast OR any other value → standard

If no USER-PROFILE.md: calibration_tier = "standard"

**Spawn Explore subagent:**

```
Task(subagent_type="gsd-assumptions-analyzer", prompt="""
Analyze the codebase for Phase {PHASE}: {phase_name}.

Phase goal: {roadmap_description}
Prior decisions: {prior_decisions_summary}
Codebase scout hints: {codebase_context_summary}
Calibration: {calibration_tier}

Your job:
1. Read ROADMAP.md phase {PHASE} description
2. Read any prior CONTEXT.md files from earlier phases
3. Glob/Grep for files related to: {phase_relevant_terms}
4. Read 5-15 most relevant source files
5. Return structured assumptions

## Output Format

Return EXACTLY this structure:

## Assumptions

### [Area Name] (e.g., "Technical Approach")
- **Assumption:** [Decision statement]
  - **Why this way:** [Evidence from codebase — cite file paths]
  - **If wrong:** [Concrete consequence of this being wrong]
  - **Confidence:** Confident | Likely | Unclear

(3-5 areas, calibrated by tier:
- full_maturity: 3-5 areas, 2-3 alternatives per Likely/Unclear item
- standard: 3-4 areas, 2 alternatives per Likely/Unclear item
- minimal_decisive: 2-3 areas, decisive single recommendation per item)

## Needs External Research
[Topics where codebase alone is insufficient — library version compatibility,
ecosystem best practices, etc. Leave empty if codebase provides enough evidence.]

${AGENT_SKILLS_ANALYZER}
""")
```

Parse the subagent's response. Extract:
- `assumptions[]` — each with area, statement, evidence, consequence, confidence
- `needs_research[]` — topics requiring external research (may be empty)

**Initialize canonical refs accumulator:**
- Source 1: Copy `Canonical refs:` from ROADMAP.md for this phase, expand to full paths
- Source 2: Check REQUIREMENTS.md and PROJECT.md for specs/ADRs referenced
- Source 3: Add any docs referenced in codebase scout results
</step>

<step name="external_research">
**Skip if:** `needs_research` from deep_codebase_analysis is empty.

If research topics were flagged, spawn a general-purpose research agent:

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="""
Research the following topics for Phase {PHASE}: {phase_name}.

Topics needing research:
{needs_research_content}

For each topic, return:
- **Finding:** [What you learned]
- **Source:** [URL or library docs reference]
- **Confidence impact:** [Which assumption this resolves and to what confidence level]

Use Context7 (resolve-library-id then query-docs) for library-specific questions.
Use WebSearch for ecosystem/best-practice questions.
""")
```

Merge findings back into assumptions:
- Update confidence levels where research resolves ambiguity
- Add source attribution to affected assumptions
- Store research findings for DISCUSSION-LOG.md

**If no gaps flagged:** Skip entirely. Most phases will skip this step.
</step>

<step name="present_assumptions">
Display all assumptions grouped by area with confidence badges.

**Format for display:**

```
## Phase {PHASE}: {phase_name} — Assumptions

Based on codebase analysis, here's what I'd go with:

### {Area Name}
{Confidence badge} **{Assumption statement}**
↳ Evidence: {file paths cited}
↳ If wrong: {consequence}

### {Area Name 2}
...

[If external research was done:]
### External Research Applied
- {Topic}: {Finding} (Source: {URL})
```

**If `--auto`:**
- If all assumptions are Confident or Likely: log assumptions, skip to write_context.
  Log: `[auto] All assumptions Confident/Likely — proceeding to context capture.`
- If any assumptions are Unclear: log a warning, auto-select recommended alternative for
  each Unclear item. Log: `[auto] {N} Unclear assumptions auto-resolved with recommended defaults.`
  Proceed to write_context.

**Otherwise:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Assumptions"
- question: "These all look right?"
- options:
  - "Yes, proceed" — Write CONTEXT.md with these assumptions as decisions
  - "Let me correct some" — Select which assumptions to change

**If "Yes, proceed":** Skip to write_context.
**If "Let me correct some":** Continue to correct_assumptions.
</step>

<step name="correct_assumptions">
The assumptions are already displayed above from present_assumptions.

Present a multiSelect where each option's label is the assumption statement and description
is the "If wrong" consequence:

Use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect):
- header: "Corrections"
- question: "Which assumptions need correcting?"
- options: [one per assumption, label = assumption statement, description = "If wrong: {consequence}"]

For each selected correction, ask ONE focused question:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "{Area Name}"
- question: "What should we do instead for: {assumption statement}?"
- options: [2-3 concrete alternatives describing user-visible outcomes, recommended option first]

Record each correction:
- Original assumption
- User's chosen alternative
- Reason (if provided via "Other" free text)

After all corrections processed, continue to write_context with updated assumptions.

**Auto mode:** Should not reach this step (--auto skips from present_assumptions).

<step name="write_context">
Create phase directory if needed. Write CONTEXT.md using the standard 6-section format.

- Corrections → override the original assumption in `<decisions>`
- Areas where all assumptions were Confident → marked as locked decisions
- Areas with corrections → include user's chosen alternative as the decision
- Folded todos → included in `<decisions>` under "### Folded Todos"
