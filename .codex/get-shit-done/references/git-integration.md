## Project Initialization (brief + roadmap together)

```
docs: initialize [project-name] ([N] phases)

[One-liner from PROJECT.md]

Phases:
1. [phase-name]: [goal]
2. [phase-name]: [goal]
3. [phase-name]: [goal]
```

What to commit:

```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: initialize [project-name] ([N] phases)" --files .planning/
```

## Task Completion (During Plan Execution)

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion.

> **Parallel agents:** When running as a parallel executor (spawned by execute-phase),
> use `--no-verify` on all commits to avoid pre-commit hook lock contention.
> The orchestrator validates hooks once after all agents complete.

```
{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name}

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat` - New feature/functionality
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `test` - Test-only (TDD RED phase)
- `refactor` - Code cleanup (TDD REFACTOR phase)
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `chore` - Dependencies, config, tooling

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard task
git add src/api/auth.ts src/types/user.ts
git commit -m "feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint

- POST /auth/register validates email and password
- Checks for duplicate users
- Returns JWT token on success
"

# TDD task - RED phase
git add src/__tests__/jwt.test.ts
git commit -m "test(07-02): add failing test for JWT generation

- Tests token contains user ID claim
- Tests token expires in 1 hour
- Tests signature verification
"

# TDD task - GREEN phase
git add src/utils/jwt.ts
git commit -m "feat(07-02): implement JWT generation

- Uses jose library for signing
- Includes user ID and expiry claims
- Signs with HS256 algorithm
"
```

## Plan Completion (After All Tasks Done)

After all tasks committed, one final metadata commit captures plan completion.

```
docs({phase}-{plan}): complete [plan-name] plan

Tasks completed: [N]/[N]
- [Task 1 name]
- [Task 2 name]
- [Task 3 name]

SUMMARY: .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md
```

What to commit:

```bash
node "/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs({phase}-{plan}): complete [plan-name] plan" --files .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/ROADMAP.md

**Note:** Code files NOT included - already committed per-task.

<example_log>

**Old approach (per-plan commits):**
```
a7f2d1 feat(checkout): Stripe payments with webhook verification
3e9c4b feat(products): catalog with search, filters, and pagination
8a1b2c feat(auth): JWT with refresh rotation using jose
5c3d7e feat(foundation): Next.js 15 + Prisma + Tailwind scaffold
2f4a8d docs: initialize ecommerce-app (5 phases)
```

**New approach (per-task commits):**
```
# Phase 04 - Checkout
1a2b3c docs(04-01): complete checkout flow plan
4d5e6f feat(04-01): add webhook signature verification
7g8h9i feat(04-01): implement payment session creation
0j1k2l feat(04-01): create checkout page component

# Phase 03 - Products
3m4n5o docs(03-02): complete product listing plan
6p7q8r feat(03-02): add pagination controls
9s0t1u feat(03-02): implement search and filters
2v3w4x feat(03-01): create product catalog schema

# Phase 02 - Auth
5y6z7a docs(02-02): complete token refresh plan
8b9c0d feat(02-02): implement refresh token rotation
1e2f3g test(02-02): add failing test for token refresh
4h5i6j docs(02-01): complete JWT setup plan
7k8l9m feat(02-01): add JWT generation and validation
0n1o2p chore(02-01): install jose library

# Phase 01 - Foundation
3q4r5s docs(01-01): complete scaffold plan
6t7u8v feat(01-01): configure Tailwind and globals
9w0x1y feat(01-01): set up Prisma with database
2z3a4b feat(01-01): create Next.js 15 project

# Initialization
5c6d7e docs: initialize ecommerce-app (5 phases)
```

Each plan produces 2-4 commits (tasks + metadata). Clear, granular, bisectable.

<anti_patterns>

**Still don't commit (intermediate artifacts):**
- PLAN.md creation (commit with plan completion)
- RESEARCH.md (intermediate)
- DISCOVERY.md (intermediate)
- Minor planning tweaks
- "Fixed typo in roadmap"

**Do commit (outcomes):**
- Each task completion (feat/fix/test/refactor)
- Plan completion metadata (docs)
- Project initialization (docs)

**Key principle:** Commit working code and shipped outcomes, not planning process.

</anti_patterns>

<commit_strategy_rationale>

## Why Per-Task Commits?

**Context engineering for AI:**
- Git history becomes primary context source for future the agent sessions
- `git log --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` shows all work for a plan
- `git diff <hash>^..<hash>` shows exact changes per task
- Less reliance on parsing SUMMARY.md = more context for actual work

**Failure recovery:**
- Task 1 committed ✅, Task 2 failed ❌
- the agent in next session: sees task 1 complete, can retry task 2
- Can `git reset --hard` to last successful task

**Debugging:**
- `git bisect` finds exact failing task, not just failing plan
- `git blame` traces line to specific task context
- Each commit is independently revertable

**Observability:**
- Solo developer + the agent workflow benefits from granular attribution
- Atomic commits are git best practice
- "Commit noise" irrelevant when consumer is the agent, not humans

<sub_repos_support>

## Multi-Repo Workspace Support (sub_repos)

For workspaces with separate git repos (e.g., `backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`), GSD routes commits to each repo independently.

### Configuration

In `.planning/config.json`, list sub-repo directories under `planning.sub_repos`:

```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "sub_repos": ["backend", "frontend", "shared"]
  }
}
```

Set `commit_docs: false` so planning docs stay local and are not committed to any sub-repo.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-detection:** During `$gsd-new-project`, directories with their own `.git` folder are detected and offered for selection as sub-repos. On subsequent runs, `loadConfig` auto-syncs the `sub_repos` list with the filesystem — adding newly created repos and removing deleted ones. This means `config.json` may be rewritten automatically when repos change on disk.
2. **File grouping:** Code files are grouped by their sub-repo prefix (e.g., `backend/src/api/users.ts` belongs to the `backend/` repo).
3. **Independent commits:** Each sub-repo receives its own atomic commit via `gsd-tools.cjs commit-to-subrepo`. File paths are made relative to the sub-repo root before staging.
4. **Planning stays local:** The `.planning/` directory is not committed; it acts as cross-repo coordination.

### Commit Routing

Instead of the standard `commit` command, use `commit-to-subrepo` when `sub_repos` is configured:

```bash
node /home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit-to-subrepo "feat(02-01): add user API" \
  --files backend/src/api/users.ts backend/src/types/user.ts frontend/src/components/UserForm.tsx
```

This stages `src/api/users.ts` and `src/types/user.ts` in the `backend/` repo, and `src/components/UserForm.tsx` in the `frontend/` repo, then commits each independently with the same message.

Files that don't match any configured sub-repo are reported as unmatched.

</sub_repos_support>
