## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-forensics`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-forensics` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected (Execute mode), present a plain-text numbered list and pick a reasonable default.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit (Codex uses per-role config, not inline model selection)
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Investigate what went wrong during a GSD workflow execution. Analyzes git history, `.planning/` artifacts, and file system state to detect anomalies and generate a structured diagnostic report.

Purpose: Diagnose failed or stuck workflows so the user can understand root cause and take corrective action.
Output: Forensic report saved to `.planning/forensics/`, presented inline, with optional issue creation.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/forensics.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Data sources:**
- `git log` (recent commits, patterns, time gaps)
- `git status` / `git diff` (uncommitted work, conflicts)
- `.planning/STATE.md` (current position, session history)
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase scope and progress)
- `.planning/phases/*/` (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md, CONTEXT.md)
- `.planning/reports/SESSION_REPORT.md` (last session outcomes)

**User input:**
- Problem description: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional — will ask if not provided)
</context>

<process>
Read and execute the forensics workflow from @/home/niko/research/agents/kotaemon/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/forensics.md end-to-end.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Evidence gathered from all available data sources
- At least 4 anomaly types checked (stuck loop, missing artifacts, abandoned work, crash/interruption)
- Structured forensic report written to `.planning/forensics/report-{timestamp}.md`
- Report presented inline with findings, anomalies, and recommendations
- Interactive investigation offered for deeper analysis
- GitHub issue creation offered if actionable findings exist
</success_criteria>

<critical_rules>
- **Read-only investigation:** Do not modify project source files during forensics. Only write the forensic report and update STATE.md session tracking.
- **Redact sensitive data:** Strip absolute paths, API keys, tokens from reports and issues.
- **Ground findings in evidence:** Every anomaly must cite specific commits, files, or state data.
- **No speculation without evidence:** If data is insufficient, say so — do not fabricate root causes.
</critical_rules>
